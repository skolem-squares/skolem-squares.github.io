Each puzzle has a unique solution that we can find by narrowing down the possibilities for each empty square, each column and the puzzle as a whole.<br>
In this example 4 is the largest number: <br>

Like in Sudoku, it's good to start with entries that have few possibilities.
In the bottom row, the third entry can only be filled with a 3.
1 and 2 both have black squares where a partner would need to be and 4 goes out of bounds of the puzzle.<br>

We can also consider the possibilities for any row or column.
For the first column, there is only one possibility.
For instance 1s can fit as the top two entries, but 2 cannot fit the bottom two entries.<br>

Each number has to appear in the puzzle. <br>
4 being the largest number has to fit somewhere in the corner of the puzzle.
Looking at the top right corner, we can see that three out of four of our potential spots for a 4 are blocked.
As a result, there is only one possible place for the 4s to go.<br>
