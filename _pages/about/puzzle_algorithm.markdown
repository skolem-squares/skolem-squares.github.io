<div class="page-wrap-text">I designed the algorithm to generate Skolem Squares by thinkingof numbers as having partners or forming pairs. In a Skolem sequence each number has a partner, a 5 has a partner 5 that is 5 spaces away. Moving to two dimensions, each number has a partner and both of those numbers must also have another partner.

As a result, each number is a corner of a medium-sized square with side length equal toone plus the number's value:

Skolem squares are built by adding the 4 numbers that make up the medium-sized square as a single unit, which I call a Skolem Entry.

This <a class="inline-link" href="/flowchart/">flowchart diagram</a> illustrates how I use Skolem entries to build Skolem Squares.
