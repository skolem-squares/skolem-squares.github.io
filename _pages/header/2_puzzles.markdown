<div class="page-wrap2">Find the right numbers to put in the white squares such that the result is a unique Skolem square! <div class="page-wrap5"><img class="half_img" src="/assets/pretty-puzzle-none.png"><img class="half_img" src="/assets/pretty-puzzle-none_solved.png"></div></div>
<div class="page-wrap2"><center>Rules:</center>
1. Skolem squares columns and rows must all be Skolem sequences. Each number has a partner in its row and column, spaced apart by the number's value.

2. A Skolem square must contain each number from 1 to a specified largest number. I've decided for now that largest number will be the side length of the Skolem square minus 2.

3. No more than one pair of a given number in any row or column. For instance, if there are two 1s in a column already, no more 1s can be in that column.
