<div class="page-wrap8">
Each puzzle has a unique solution that we can find by narrowing down the possibilities for each empty square, each row/column and the puzzle as a whole.
4 is the largest number in this example:

<div class="page-wrap8">
Like in Sudoku, a good place to start is with places that have fewer possibilities.
For instance, C1 only has one possible entry: 3.
1 is blocked by B1, C2, and D1.
2 is blocked by C3.
4 requires partners that exceed the puzzle's boundaries.
</div>

<div class="page-wrap9"><img class="example_img" src="/assets/example-page/4-6-6-example1.png"></div>

<div class="page-wrap8">
We can also consider the possibilities for any row or column.
In this example column A only has one possible sequence.
A5 and A6 can't both be 1, because then A1 and A3 would need to be 2 but that's blocked by C3, where a 2 would also need to be.
</div>

<div class="page-wrap8">
We also know that each number has to appear in the puzzle.
4 being the largest number has to fit somewhere in the corners of the puzzle.
Looking at the top right corner, E6, F5 and F6 are all blocked.
Therefore, a 4 must go in the E5 square.
Any other spot in the puzzle and the 4's partners would exceed the puzzle boundaries.

And finally here is the answer:
