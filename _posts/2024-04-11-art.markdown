  Skolem square puzzles are prevented from having horizontal, vertical or diagonal symmetry. However, I found that when I allowed for symmetry the result could be visually pleasing. I sampled colors from a matplotlib colorscheme at regular intervals and assigned those colors to each number: 1, 2 and so on.
