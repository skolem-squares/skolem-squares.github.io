<div class="page-wrap2">
1. Skolem Squares columns and rows must all be Skolem sequences. 
<br>

2. A Skolem Square must contain each number from 1 to the largest which varies from puzzle to puzzle.
<br>

3. No more than one pair of a given number in any row or column. For instance, if there are two 1s in a column already, then no more 1s can be in that column.
