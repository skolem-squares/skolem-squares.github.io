Skolem and Langford sequences were discovered independently by mathematicians Dudley Langford and Th Skolem in 1957 and 1958.
Langford was inspired by watching his kid play with colored blocks.

Skolem sequences: 41134232, more examples

Langford sequences: 41312432, more examples

In both cases we would say the Langford or Skolem sequence is order n and defect 1, meaning we start with 1 and the largest number is n.
Hooked skolem sequences can have 0s or empty spaces: 41134030

The Langford problem asks the question for which n do Langford (and Skolem) sequences exist.
