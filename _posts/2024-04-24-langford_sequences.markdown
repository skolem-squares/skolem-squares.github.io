Skolem and Langford sequences were discovered independently by mathematicians Dudley Langford and Th Skolem in 1957 and 1958.
Langford was inspired by watching his kid play with colored blocks.

Skolem sequences:

Langford sequences:

A general formula for Skolem Sequences can be given as follows.
Two of each number S = [1,2 ...n] with the property:
b_k - a_k = t_k for k = 1,2 ...n. 

Skolem sequences:
b_k -a_k = k
S = [1,2...n]
T = [1,2...n]

Langford sequences:
b_k -a_k = k + 1
S = [1,2...n]
T = [2...n+1]

In both cases we would say the Langford or Skolem sequence is order n and defect 1, meaning we start with 1 and the largest number is n.

The Langford problem asks the question for which n do Langford (and Skolem) sequences exist.
