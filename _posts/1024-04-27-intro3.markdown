text: "Skolem squares are easier to visualize with colors. The zeroes are blanks or empty spaces which are colored black." 
text2: "We can see that the 1s, 2s and 3s all form the corners of a medium-sized square with side length equal to the value in the small squares plus one."

text: "A zero in a Skolem sequence is a blank or empty space, which I represent by coloring them black."

"A property of Skolem squares is that the small squares form the corners of a medium-sized square. The side length of that medium-sized square is equal to the value in the small squares plus one."
