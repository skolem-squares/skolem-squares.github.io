text: "A zero in a Skolem sequence is a blank or empty space, which I represent by coloring them black."
text2: "In order to understand Skolem sequences, let us consider a single sequence with no zeroes: 41134232. It is unique, though we could flip it around: 23243114. We can also extend the pattern to include 5: 5113453242. Can you spot the pattern? Hint - why are there two of each number?"
