I think the best games are simple in their rules but complex in their execution. Games like Chess, Go and Chinese Checkers are among my favorites.

Then in college I saw how a simple puzzle like 2048 could become very popular.

When designed Skolem Squares, simplicity was my guiding philosophy. I liked the idea that the puzzle would start with nothing more than black, blank spaces and empty, white spaces.

I considered and discarded other possibilities such as having arrows indicating a single direction for that space's partner that would require more complex rules.

My main concern was that I wouldn't be able to pack enough numbers into the Skolem Square, that they'd be too sparse and mostly zeroes. I couldn't think of any other way to test if this would be the case other than building the Skolem Squares.

To my relief, I've now generated Skolem Sequences that are over 90% non-zero entries, using techniques such as backtracking and weighted random number generators.
