I've always enjoyed games and puzzles, from my early years playing Scrabble with my family to becoming captain of my college's Chess team. 

The games I appreciated the most were simple in their rules but complex in their execution. Games like Go and Chinese Checkers particularly appealed to me.

As well, in college I saw how a simple puzzle like 2048 could become very popular. 

When designed Skolem Squares, simplicity was my guiding philosophy. I liked the idea that the puzzle would start with nothing more than black, blank spaces and empty, white spaces.

I considered and discarded other possibilities such as having arrows indicating a single direction for that space's partner.

My main concern was that I wouldn't be able to pack enough numbers into the Skolem Square, that they'd be too sparse and mostly zeroes. I couldn't think of any other way to test if this would be the case other than building the Skolem Squares.

Thankfully, I've now generated Skolem Sequences that are over 90% non-zero entries, using techniques such as backtracking and weighted random number generators.
