skolem-squares.github.io will continue to be updated with new puzzles, art and more! If you'd like to be notified when new puzzles are available, let me know by sending me a note in the form at the bottom of the page along with your email.

In the long term, I'm looking to improve my algorithm for generating Skolem Squares while testing different rules and parameters. Then I'll develop an app for playing the puzzles once I have settled on a design and have a good number of puzzles to upload. 

Feel free to add me on Instagram, Linkedin or follow me on Github!
