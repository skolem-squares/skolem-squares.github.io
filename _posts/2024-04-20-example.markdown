Each puzzle has a unique solution that we can find by narrowing down the possibilities for each empty square, each column and the puzzle as a whole.<br>
In this example 4 is the largest number: <br>

Like in Sudoku, it's good to start with entries that have few possibilities.

As a result, there is only one possible place for the 4s to go.<br>
