  <p>Skolem and Langford sequences were discovered independently by mathematicians Dudley Langford and Th Skolem in 1957 and 1958.
Langford was inspired by watching his kid play with colored blocks.</p>

<p>Skolem sequences:</p>

<p>Langford sequences:</p>

<p>A general formula for Skolem Sequences can be given as follows.
Two of each number S = [1,2 …n] with the property:
b_k - a_k = t_k for k = 1,2 …n.</p>

<p>Skolem sequences:
b_k -a_k = k
S = [1,2…n]
T = [1,2…n]</p>

<p>Langford sequences:
b_k -a_k = k + 1
S = [1,2…n]
T = [2…n+1]</p>

<p>In both cases we would say the Langford or Skolem sequence is order n and defect 1, meaning we start with 1 and the largest number is n.</p>

<p>The Langford problem asks the question for which n do Langford (and Skolem) sequences exist.
