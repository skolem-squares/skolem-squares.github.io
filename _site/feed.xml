<p>Skolem and Langford sequences were discovered independently by mathematicians Dudley Langford and Thoralf Skolem in 1957 and 1958. Langford was inspired by watching his kid play with colored blocks, observing that there was one block between the red blocks, two blocks between the blue blocks and three blocks between the green blocks:</p>

<p>
Langford found sequences following this pattern for numbers: 4, 7, 8, 11, 12 and 15. However, he was unable to find sequences for 5, 6, 9 and 10. Langford’s problem asks the question for which <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> can Langford sequences be constructed.
Here are a few Langford sequences for <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> = 3, 4</span> and <span class="math inline">7</span>:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<span class="math inline">312132</span>, <span class="math inline">41312432</span>, <span class="math inline">45671415362732</span>
</p>
<p>
Skolem sequences are similar, indexing at 0 instead of 1 for the numbers separating each pair. Here are a few Skolem sequences for <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> = 4, 5</span> and <span class="math inline">8</span>:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<span class="math inline">41134232</span>, <span class="math inline">5113453242</span>, <span class="math inline">8113673485647252</span>
</p>
<p>
A pattern emerges, for both Skolem and Langford sequences if <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> is divisible by 4 then solutions exist. Langford sequences also appear to have solutions if after dividing <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> by 4 there is a remainder of 3 and Skolem sequences have solutions if the remainder is 1.
</p>
<p>
To solve Langford’s problem conclusively however, we need to show that this pattern will be true for any <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> ∈ ℕ</span>. <a href="/skolem_proof/">
Here is a solution for Skolem Sequences</a>. Langford sequences can be solved in a very similar manner.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Definition:</strong> Langford and Skolem sequences can both be generalized as follows:
Two of each number <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> = [1, 2...<em>n</em>]
</span> with the property: <span class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> = <em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> + <em>t</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> for <span class="math inline"><em>i</em> = 1, 2...<em>n</em>.</span>
Langford sequences: <span class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> = <em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> + <em>i</em> + 1</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> = [1, 2...<em>n</em>]</span> and <span class="math inline"><em>i</em> = 2...<em>n</em> + 1</span>
Skolem sequences: <span class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> = <em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> + <em>i</em></span>, <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> = [1, 2...<em>n</em>]</span> and <span class="math inline"><em>i</em> = 1, 2...<em>n</em></span>
</p>
<p>
In both cases we would say the Langford or Skolem sequence is order n and defect 1, meaning we start with 1 and the largest number is <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>.
</p>
<p>
We can even further generalize Langford and Skolem sequences in a couple ways.
For instance, hooked Skolem and Langford sequences allows zeroes or empty spots: <span class="math inline">41134030</span>
Additionally, we can have a Skolem or Langford sequence that contains only a subset of <span class="math inline">1, 2...<em>n</em></span> such as: <span class="math inline">75311357</span>
</p>
<p>
Skolem squares use both these properties, allowing 0s and a subset of <span class="math inline">1, 2..<em>n</em></span> in each row and column of the square.

<img class="example_img" src="/assets/example-page/4-6-6.png" />
</div>

<div class="page-wrap">
Like in Sudoku, it's good to start with entries that have few possibilities.
In the bottom row, the third entry can only be filled with a 3.
1 and 2 both have black squares where a partner would need to be and 4 goes out of bounds of the puzzle.<br />
</div>
<div class="page-wrap">


<img class="example_img" src="/assets/example-page/4-6-6-example1.png" />
</div>

<div class="page-wrap">
We can also consider the possibilities for any row or column.
For the first column, there is only one possibility.
For instance 1s can fit as the top two entries, but 2 cannot fit the bottom two entries.<br />

<div class="page-wrap">
Each number has to appear in the puzzle. <br />
4 being the largest number has to fit somewhere in the corner of the puzzle.
Looking at the top right corner, we can see that three out of four of our potential spots for a 4 are blocked.
As a result, there is only one possible place for the 4s to go.<br />

<p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> For which <span class="math inline">\(n \in \mathbb{N}\)</span> does there exists a Skolem sequence?<br />
<strong>Introduction:</strong> A Skolem sequence of order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is a permutation of the sequence: <span class="math inline">\(S = [1, 1, 2, 2, ... , n, n]\)</span>.<br />
Each number <span class="math inline">\(i = 1...n\)</span> appears twice in the sequence, the position of the first instance of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> we will call <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> and the second <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span>.<br />
A Skolem sequence also has the property that each pair of numbers <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> are separated in position equal to their value, <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. That is, <span class="math inline">\(y_i = x_i + i\)</span>.<br />
<strong>Proof:</strong> Let S be a Skolem sequence, with the position of each number given as: <span class="math inline">\(P = [{x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,...,x_n,y_n}] = [1, 2, ... , 2n]\)</span>.<br />
Consider the sum of positions <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> in the sequence Skolem sequence <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\sum P = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i + \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i = 1 + 2 + ... + 2n\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(y_i = x_i + i\)</span>. we can rewrite the left side: <span class="math display">\[\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i + \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i + \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i + i) = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i + \sum_{i=1}^{n} i\]</span></p>
<p>So now our equation can be written as: <span class="math display">\[2\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i + \sum_{i=1}^{n} i  = 1 + 2 + ... + 2n\]</span></p>
<p>We can use the fact that the sum of numbers 1, 2, .. n = <span class="math inline">\(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\)</span>. <span class="math display">\[2\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i + \frac{n(n+1)}{2}  = \frac{2n(2n+1)}{2}\]</span></p>
<p>We can rearrange terms to isolate the sum of the <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>s. <span class="math display">\[\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \frac{2n(2n+1) - n(n+1)}{4}\]</span></p>
<p>Multiplying out the right side of the equation we get: <span class="math display">\[\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \frac{4n^2 + 2n - n^2 - n}{4} = \frac{3n^2 + n}{4}\]</span><br />
The <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\)</span> will be an integer, therefore so must <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3n^2 + n}{4}\)</span>. Now, with out new equation, lets consider <span class="math inline">\(1, 2, ... n \bmod{4}\)</span>.<br />
If <span class="math inline">\(n \bmod{4} = 0\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is a multiple of 4 and so is <span class="math inline">\(3n^2 + n\)</span> since we can factor out a 4 from each term.<br />
If <span class="math inline">\(n \bmod{4} = 1\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(3n^2 + n = 3(1+4i)^2 + 1 + 4i = 12i^2 + 28i + 4\)</span> is also a multiple of 4.<br />
If <span class="math inline">\(n \bmod{4} = 2\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(3n^2 + n = 3(2+4i)^2 + 2 + 4i = 12i^2 + 52i + 14\)</span> is not divisible by 4.<br />
If <span class="math inline">\(n \bmod{4} = 3\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(3n^2 + n = 3(3+4i)^2 + 3 + 4i = 12i^2 + 76i + 30\)</span> is not divisible by 4.<br />
So we can conclude that Skolem sequences only exist for <span class="math inline">\(n \bmod{4} = 0, 1\)</span>.</p>

Introduction: A Skolem sequence of order \(n\) is a permutation of the sequence: \(S = [1, 1, 2, 2, ... , n, n]\). Each number \(i = 1...n\) appears twice in the sequence, the position of the first instance of \(i\) we will call \(x_i\) and the second \(y_i\). A Skolem sequence also has the property that each pair of numbers \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) are separated in position equal to their value, \(i\). That is, \(y_i = x_i + i\). Proof: Let S be a Skolem sequence, with the position of each number given as: \(P = [{x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,...,x_n,y_n}] = [1, 2, ... , 2n]\).

If \(n \bmod{4} = 1\), then \(3n^2 + n = 3(1+4i)^2 + 1 + 4i = 12i^2 + 28i + 4\) is also a multiple of 4. If \(n \bmod{4} = 2\), then \(3n^2 + n = 3(2+4i)^2 + 2 + 4i = 12i^2 + 52i + 14\) is not divisible by 4.
