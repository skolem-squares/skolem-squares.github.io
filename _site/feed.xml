<p>Skolem sequences:</p>

<p>Langford sequences:</p>

<p>A general formula for Skolem Sequences can be given as follows.
Two of each number S = [1,2 …n] with the property:
b_k - a_k = t_k for k = 1,2 …n.</p>

<p>Skolem sequences:
b_k -a_k = k
S = [1,2…n]
T = [1,2…n]</p>

<p>Langford sequences:
b_k -a_k = k + 1
S = [1,2…n]
T = [2…n+1]</p>

<p>In both cases we would say the Langford or Skolem sequence is order n and defect 1, meaning we start with 1 and the largest number is n.</p>

<p>The Langford problem asks the question for which n do Langford (and Skolem) sequences exist.

In a Skolem sequence each number has a partner. Moving to two dimensions, each number has a partner and both of those numbers must also have another partner. This is only possible if all 4 numbers are lined up to form a square:

The puzzle is built by adding all 4 numbers together as a square, which I will call a Skolem entry.

Each puzzle has a unique solution that we can find by narrowing down the possibilities for each empty square, each column and the puzzle as a whole.<br />
In this example 4 is the largest number: <br />

Like in Sudoku, it's good to start with entries that have few possibilities.
In the bottom row, the third entry can only be filled with a 3.
1 and 2 both have black squares where a partner would need to be and 4 goes out of bounds of the puzzle.<br />
</div>
<div class="page-wrap">


<img class="example_img" src="/assets/example-page/4-6-6-example1.png" />
</div>

<div class="page-wrap">
We can also consider the possibilities for any row or column.
For the first column, there is only one possibility.
For instance 1s can fit as the top two entries, but 2 cannot fit the bottom two entries.<br />

<div class="page-wrap">

<div class="page-wrap">
Each number has to appear in the puzzle. <br />
4 being the largest number has to fit somewhere in the corner of the puzzle.
Looking at the top right corner, we can see that three out of four of our potential spots for a 4 are blocked.
As a result, there is only one possible place for the 4s to go.<br />

  Skolem square puzzles are prevented from having horizontal, vertical or diagonal symmetry. However, I found that when I allowed for symmetry the result could be visually pleasing. I sampled colors from a matplotlib colorscheme at regular intervals and assigned those colors to each number: 1, 2 and so on.
